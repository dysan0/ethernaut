# Denial
Difficulty: 5/10

This is a simple wallet that drips funds over time. You can withdraw the funds slowly by becoming a withdrawing partner.

If you can deny the owner from withdrawing funds when they call `withdraw()` (whilst the contract still has funds, and the transaction is of 1M gas or less) you will win this level.

    address payable public constant owner = address(0xA9E);
    uint timeLastWithdrawn;
    mapping(address => uint) withdrawPartnerBalances; // keep track of partners balances

    function setWithdrawPartner(address _partner) public {
        partner = _partner;
    }

    // withdraw 1% to recipient and 1% to owner
    function withdraw() public {
        uint amountToSend = address(this).balance.div(100);
        // perform a call without checking return
        // The recipient can revert, the owner will still get their share
        partner.call{value:amountToSend}("");
        owner.transfer(amountToSend);
        // keep track of last withdrawal time
        timeLastWithdrawn = now;
        withdrawPartnerBalances[partner] = withdrawPartnerBalances[partner].add(amountToSend);
    }

    // allow deposit of funds
    receive() external payable {}

    // convenience function
    function contractBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

# Solution
To solve this solution, you need to create a contract and set `setWithdrawPartner` to the contract address.

You need to cause a denail of service for the owner of the contract, when they call `withdraw()`. The `withdraw()` function does not have protection for re-entrancy, which means we can utilize this to cause a denial of service.

In your solution contract you need to configure `fallback()` or `receive()` and cause an infinite loop. Here is an example:

``` solidity
  receive() external payable {
    //a is the denail service contract.
    a.withdraw();  
  }
```

The above causes an infinite loop until the gas runs out. This prevents the owner.transfer() call because the partner.call{}("") causes an infinite loop.

To solve this, you need to deploy the `Approval.sol` contract and call `setWithdrawPartner()`. When you submit your instance, the game will send token to your contract which will cause the infinite loop.

# Completion Message
```
Level completed!

This level demonstrates that external calls to unknown contracts can still create denial of service attack vectors if a fixed amount of gas is not specified.

If you are using a low level call to continue executing in the event an external call reverts, ensure that you specify a fixed gas stipend. For example call.gas(100000).value().

Typically one should follow the checks-effects-interactions(http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern) pattern to avoid reentrancy attacks, there can be other circumstances (such as multiple external calls at the end of a function) where issues such as this can arise.

Note: An external CALL can use at most 63/64 of the gas currently available at the time of the `CALL`. Thus, depending on how much gas is required to complete a transaction, a transaction of sufficiently high gas (i.e. one such that 1/64 of the gas is capable of completing the remaining opcodes in the parent call) can be used to mitigate this particular attack.
