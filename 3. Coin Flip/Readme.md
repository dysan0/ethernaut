# Coin Flip
Difficulty: 3/10

This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

# Solution
The contract code above is using public blockchain information as seed for a random coin flip game. The fact is that all that information is available on the block chain and accessible by other contracts.

For the solution you will need to write a solidity contract that uses the same pseudo random number generator as above code. Knowing the results of the random number generator allows you to correctly guess the results of the flip.

The code can be viewed in Flipper.sol

# Completion Message
```
Level completed!

Generating random numbers in solidity can be tricky. There currently isn't a native way to generate them, and everything you use in smart contracts is publicly visible, including the local variables and state variables marked as private. Miners also have control over things like blockhashes, timestamps, and whether to include certain transactions - which allows them to bias these values in their favor.

To get cryptographically proven random numbers, you can use Chainlink VRF, which uses an oracle, the LINK token, and an on-chain contract to verify that the number is truly random.

Some other options include using Bitcoin block headers (verified through BTC Relay), RANDAO, or Oraclize).
