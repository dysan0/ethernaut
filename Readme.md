# About

This github repo hosts my solutions to the Ethernaut Challenge.

# What is Ethernaut by OpenZeppelin?

"The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players. Do you have an interesting idea? PRs are welcome at github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut."[1]
