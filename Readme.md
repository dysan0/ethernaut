# About

This github repo hosts my solutions to the Ethernaut Challenge. I learned a lot about solidity doing these challenges. My most favorite challenge was the `Alien Codex`, which taught me a lot about EVM storage. My least favorite challenge was `Gatekeeper One`, which helped me get close and personal with the remix debugger.

I would highly recommend the Ethernaut Challenges to everyone!!!

# What is Ethernaut by OpenZeppelin?

"The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players. Do you have an interesting idea? PRs are welcome at github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut."[1]
